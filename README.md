# Protection-against-scalper-bots
Proof of concept of detecting and banning scalper bots from e-commerce stores using mouse movement logging and analyses and typing speed logging and analyses 

Introduction:
This project was produced for my dissertation. It looks at user inputs such as mouse position and typing speed then checks these against pattens that were identified in the testing phase of this project. It then uses these pattens to check to see if the user is a scalper bot or not. This was then tested using three different types of bots and compared to googles CAPTCHA V2 bot protection.

## Elements of the project
